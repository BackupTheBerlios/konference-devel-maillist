Subject: [Konference-devel] debain sarge compile problems (0.1 and cvs)
Message-ID: <200402050044.52615.ach@mpe.mpg.de>

Hello,

First a simple question? What's the difference between konference and
videoconference?

Okay now the real stuff:
While trying to compile 0.1 tar ball or cvs checkout I got several of
those errors (make -k ;)

/usr/include/linux/videodev2.h is from 2.5.999 ;) kernel.
gcc is 3.3.2

Other software installed to make configure happy:

 libpt-dev (>= 1.5.2), libopenh323-dev (>=1.11.7), kdelibs4-dev (>=3.2)


Other compile problems are:

Any hint welcome!

P.S. some screenshots on berlios would be nice too ;)

  To me vi is Zen.  To use vi is to practice zen. Every command is
  a koan. Profound to the user, unintelligible to the uninitiated.
  You discover truth everytime you use it.
